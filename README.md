# Installing React Dependencies 
```npm install --legacy-peer-deps```

## I did the fronted in react/scss. React part is hosted on firebase, PHP is hosted on 000webhost.
## I had no prior experience with PHP, but I grasped the concept of how it works and put it in the action from working on Django.
## For testing purposes I set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *. 
## I chose not to overcomplicate project by styling it too much. I can certainly do more in terms of appearance. (websites I included in portfolio demonstrate this)
